By itself this is harmless. However, suppose you have a proxy or reverse-proxy that tries to analyze HTTP requests, and your proxy has a _different_ bug in parsing Chunked-Encoding, acting as if the format is:  - chunk length - `\\r\\n` - `length` bytes of content - more bytes of content, as many as it takes until you find a `\\r\\n`  For example, [pound](https://github.com/graygnuorg/pound/pull/43) had this bug -- it can happen if an implementer uses a generic \"read until end of line\" helper to consumes the trailing `\\r\\n`.  In this case, h11 and your proxy may both accept the same stream of bytes, but interpret them differently. For example, consider the following HTTP request(s) (assume all line breaks are `\\r\\n`):  ``` GET /one HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Transfer-Encoding: chunked  5 AAAAAXX2 45 0  GET /two HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Transfer-Encoding: chunked  0 ```  Here h11 will interpret it as two requests, one with body `AAAAA45` and one with an empty body, while our hypothetical buggy proxy will interpret it as a single request, with body `AAAAXX20\\r\\n\\r\\nGET /two ...`. And any time two HTTP processors both accept the same string of bytes but interpret them differently, you have the conditions for a \"request smuggling\" attack. For example, if `/two` is a dangerous endpoint and the job of the reverse proxy is to stop requests from getting there, then an attacker could use a bytestream like the above to circumvent this protection.  Even worse, if our buggy reverse proxy receives two requests from different users:  ``` GET /one HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Transfer-Encoding: chunked  5 AAAAAXX999 0 ```  ``` GET /two HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Cookie: SESSION_KEY=abcdef... ```  ...it will consider the first request to be complete and valid, and send both on to the h11-based web server over the same socket. The server will then see the two concatenated requests, and interpret them as _one_ request to `/one` whose body includes `/two`'s session key, potentially allowing one user to steal another's credentials.  ### Patches  Fixed in h11 0.15.0.  ### Workarounds  Since exploitation requires the combination of buggy h11 with a buggy (reverse) proxy, fixing either component is sufficient to mitigate this issue.  ### Credits  Reported by Jeppe Bonde Weikop on 2025-01-09."}]}, {"name": "hiredis", "version": "3.3.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "httpcore", "version": "1.0.7", "vulns": []}, {"name": "httptools", "version": "0.7.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "httpx", "version": "0.28.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "idna", "version": "3.10", "vulns": []}, {"name": "iniconfig", "version": "2.3.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "itsdangerous", "version": "2.2.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "jinja2", "version": "3.1.6", "vulns": []}, {"name": "jiter", "version": "0.8.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "license-expression", "version": "30.4.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "limits", "version": "5.6.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "mako", "version": "1.3.10", "vulns": []}, {"name": "markdown-it-py", "version": "4.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "markupsafe", "version": "2.1.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "mdurl", "version": "0.1.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "msgpack", "version": "1.1.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "numpy", "version": "2.2.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "openai", "version": "1.58.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "openpyxl", "version": "3.1.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "packageurl-python", "version": "0.17.6", "vulns": []}, {"name": "packaging", "version": "25.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pandas", "version": "2.2.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pip", "version": "25.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pip-api", "version": "0.0.34", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pip-audit", "version": "2.10.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pip-requirements-parser", "version": "32.0.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "platformdirs", "version": "4.5.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pluggy", "version": "1.6.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "py-serializable", "version": "2.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pycparser", "version": "2.23", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pydantic", "version": "2.12.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pydantic-core", "version": "2.41.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pydantic-settings", "version": "2.12.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pygments", "version": "2.19.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pyparsing", "version": "3.3.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pytest", "version": "9.0.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pytest-asyncio", "version": "1.3.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pytest-cov", "version": "7.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pytest-mock", "version": "3.15.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "python-dateutil", "version": "2.9.0.post0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "python-dotenv", "version": "1.2.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "python-json-logger", "version": "2.0.7", "vulns": []}, {"name": "python-multipart", "version": "0.0.21", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pytz", "version": "2025.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pyyaml", "version": "6.0.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "redis", "version": "5.0.8", "vulns": []}, {"name": "requests", "version": "2.32.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "rich", "version": "14.2.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "ruff", "version": "0.8.6", "vulns": []}, {"name": "six", "version": "1.17.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "slowapi", "version": "0.1.9", "vulns": []}, {"name": "sniffio", "version": "1.3.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "sortedcontainers", "version": "2.4.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "sqlalchemy", "version": "2.0.45", "vulns": []}, {"name": "starlette", "version": "0.50.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tomli", "version": "2.3.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tomli-w", "version": "1.2.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tqdm", "version": "4.67.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "typing-extensions", "version": "4.15.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "typing-inspection", "version": "0.4.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tzdata", "version": "2025.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "urllib3", "version": "2.6.0", "vulns": [{"id": "CVE-2026-21441", "fix_versions": ["2.6.3"], "aliases": ["GHSA-38jv-5279-wg99"], "description": "### Impact  urllib3's [streaming API](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/2.6.2/advanced-usage.html#streaming-and-i-o) is designed for the efficient handling of large HTTP responses by reading the content in chunks, rather than loading the entire response body into memory at once.  urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP `Content-Encoding` header (e.g., `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, or `zstd`). When using the streaming API, the library decompresses only the necessary bytes, enabling partial content consumption.  However, for HTTP redirect responses, the library would read the entire response body to drain the connection and decompress the content unnecessarily. This decompression occurred even before any read methods were called, and configured read limits did not restrict the amount of decompressed data. As a result, there was no safeguard against decompression bombs. A malicious server could exploit this to trigger excessive resource consumption on the client (high CPU usage and large memory allocations for decompressed data; CWE-409).  ### Affected usages  Applications and libraries using urllib3 version 2.6.2 and earlier to stream content from untrusted sources by setting `preload_content=False` when they do not disable redirects.   ### Remediation  Upgrade to at least urllib3 v2.6.3 in which the library does not decode content of redirect responses when `preload_content=False`.
